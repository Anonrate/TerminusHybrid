# TerminusHybrid
Terminus Font Modernized from BDF to TTF to TTC

### Objective
Have you ever used or wanted to use the font [Terminus][1], but weren't able to due to complications such as that being a bitmap font, most distroubitions don't *allow* or don't recommend their use, and recommend *scalable* fonts?  Or the terminal you're trying to use doesn't support bitmap fonts?  If so, you may want to keep reading.  If you're able to use bitmap fonts, I do so recommend using them, as they are faster, and the majority of the time will be of better quality.  But if you can't, and you need to use an *Outline* font,  **TerminusHybrid** is where it proves useful.  All that **TerminusHybrid** is, is basically the [Terminus][1] font but in outline form or *TTF* with the added features of having the original BDF files included and further styles implemented in the font itself.

### Approach
The approach is reletivly simple.  All I am doing is importing the BDF files into [FontForge][2] and manually tracing them myself, so they are free of flaws and don't look like shit.  I am also moderinsaing it making it round with keeping the structural look and feeling that of what was intended.
