# TerminusHybrid
Terminus Font Modernized from BDF to TTF to TTC

## TODO:
- Create detailed README
- Fill in the TODO list with more shit todo

## ATTENTION
I am (Or might be) taking a bit of a break.  I have been working on this sooo long.  Months actually.  The ter-u24n project has what I would say the best work yet.  But it doesn't meet my needs for my monitor of which is 186ppi.  And being that I have OCD, it neeeds to be pretty much perfect.  If you're actually interested in and woudl like to see more sooner rather than later, just let me know.  I'm still always on my computer.

This font is based on [Terminus][1]
